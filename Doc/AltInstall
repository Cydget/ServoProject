Alternate way to install bootloader using openocd on windows using stlinkv2 clone.
If you have installed openocd on windows using https://xpack.github.io/dev-tools/openocd/
Modify the openocd.cfg file to have:
           source [find interface/stlink.cfg]
           transport select hla_swd
Modify this file
  C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Roaming\xPacks\@xpack-dev-tools\openocd\0.12.0-2.1\.content\openocd\scripts\target\at91samdXX.cfg
Change this line 
   set _CPUTAPID 0x4ba00477
To this line
   set _CPUTAPID 0x0bc11477


Another note: install zadig and replace the stlink driver with the one named libusb-win32. The default winusb driver may not work. Also windows likes to reinstall the old driver at times.
