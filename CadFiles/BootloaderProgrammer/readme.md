This model allows you to 3d print a jig so that you do not need to solder wires on each board you wish to flash the bootloader to.

Pogo pins I used: 
`P50-B1`

Resin Printer I used: 
`elegoo mars 2 pro`

other notes: 
- if you want to use a fdm 3d printer pogo pin hole diameter may need to be increased. Model has extra holes for testing out what the ideal size is for your printer.
